1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It created .git folder which is a meta data needed for keeping track of the files.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a logical group of files.
It is different from the working directory because it contains only a part of
the files/directories in the working directory. The items that can go in the
staging area are the ones that have been modified since the last commit.
It is also different from the repository because the staging are cannot keep track
of the entire history of the files, but only since the last commit.
The staging area is useful when deciding which files/directories to be in a commit.
