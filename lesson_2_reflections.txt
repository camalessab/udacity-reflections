1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It created .git folder which is a meta data needed for keeping track of the files.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the working directory because not all the files
or directories from the working directory goes to the staging area. It stores
information about what will go into the next commit. The users decide which
modified files/dir to stage.
It is also different from the repository because the staging area cannot keep track
of the entire history of the files, but only since the last commit.
The staging area is useful when deciding which modified files/directories to be
in the next commit.
